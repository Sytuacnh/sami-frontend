                                            Jieon is part of the Class of 2021 at Basis San Antonio Shavano. She has a love for classical music, and she is the principal oboist of the San Antonio Youth Orchestra Symphony. Studying is great, but taking time off to play the oboe is a great way to lessen the stress that comes from school work and extracurricular activities. Speaking of extracurricular activities, she is a member of the Yearbook and Journalism clubs, Red Cross club, UIL club, and the BASIS Volleyball team. She is also the current NHS Secretary and the former NJHS Secretary. But perhaps, she is most proud to be an active volunteer in Childrenâ€™s Association for Maximum Potential, where they provide recreation and respite for the mentally and physically disabled. Indulging oneself in volunteer activities is as important as studying in terms of personal growth and enrichment. Although her passion more deeply lies in the fields of science, she does believe that math is an important subject that one must have a thorough understanding of in order to have a successful school career. I thus choose to help other students better perform in their math classes; not only does she tutor in SaMi, but she also tutors Pre-Cal to peers during school days and visits Calculus student support to help students prepare for their next exams. She sure hopes SaMi gives a chance for every young, ambitious child to excel in all future math courses and competitions.

                                            David is part of the class of 2021 at Basis San Antonio Shavano Campus. He has joined the tutoring program in order to share his knowledge of mathematics to curious kids that want to excel in the subject. He has taken courses such as Algebra I, Algebra II, Calculus AB, and Calculus BC during his time at Basis. He knows that SaMi is a unique organization that gives opportunities to many students and aims to teach them both to expand his knowledge of teaching and explaining topics. All in all, SaMi has allowed tutors like David to reach and connect with kids across San Antonio to both his and their benefit.

                                            Preston is part of the Class of 2021 at Basis San Antonio Shavano. His favorite classes are Multivariable Calculus, AP Physics C, and AP Computer Science A. Math, science, and computer science have always been some of a many number of passions of him, and that is why he has decided to help provide resources for younger children to pursue goals in these fields through programs like SaMi and tutoring students outside of the classroom. By doing so he hopes to prepare them for competitions such as MATHCOUNTS and UIL by utilizing knowledge from some of his own experiences in these competitions to help them understand and interpret problems they may see in these competitions.
